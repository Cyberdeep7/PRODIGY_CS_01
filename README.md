Implement Caesar Cipher
# Caesar Cipher Implementation

## Overview
The **Caesar Cipher** is a simple and widely known encryption technique that involves shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed amount. This repository contains a Python program that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.

## Features
- Encrypts text using a user-defined shift key.
- Decrypts text using the same shift key.
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Ignores non-alphabetic characters.
- Allows user input for messages and shift values.

## How It Works
1. The user inputs a message and a shift value.
2. Each letter in the message is shifted forward (for encryption) or backward (for decryption) by the shift key value.
3. The shifting follows a circular pattern, meaning 'Z' shifted forward becomes 'A'.
4. Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.

## Installation
No external dependencies are required. You only need Python installed on your system.
